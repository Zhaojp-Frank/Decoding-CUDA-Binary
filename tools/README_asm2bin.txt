========ASM2BIN=========
========================

Our asm2bin program can parse assembly code in the format generated by our bin2asm tool, and modify CUDA binaries.
If you want to modify the GPU code programmatically, consider doing so from inside this tool; in asm2bin.ypp, you'll
	find a comment that says: //This is where we might call functions to modify or optimize the GPU code.

Below are some examples of how to run the program, and brief descriptions of the results.

./asm2bin assembly.txt -printBlocks
This parses the GPU code in assembly.txt, and outputs it to stdout in a more human-readable format.
Note that asm2bin can also accept the human-readable format as input.

./asm2bin assembly.txt -write program.exe
This parses the GPU code in assembly.txt, and overwrites the matching kernel function in program.exe.
Warning: if new assembly is larger than the original, and you're on a non-Linux machine, 
         then our tool will terminate without modifying the binary.
